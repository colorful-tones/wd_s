# Welcome to PatternPack
This is an example pattern library built by [PatternPack](http://patternpack.org/), a tool for designing and documenting User Interface code, then sharing it among multiple applications.

While this is a very stock implementation, PatternPack has [many options](https://github.com/patternpack/patternpack#options) to customize it to your needs, including custom themes for your documentation, Sass and LESS support, and more.

## Next Steps
This project can serve as a starting point for your own pattern library, or simply as a reference point when [building your own from scratch](https://github.com/patternpack/patternpack/blob/develop/docs/tutorial.md). Be sure to take a look at all the PatternPack [Guides and Resources](https://github.com/patternpack/patternpack/blob/develop/docs/docs.md).

## Help & Support
If you have questions, bugs, or enhancement requests you can [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/patternpack/patternpack/issues). We also have a [Slack Channel](http://slack.patternpack.org/).
